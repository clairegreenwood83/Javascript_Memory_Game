# Javascript_Memory_Game

A fun and interactive memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Test your memory by trying to find matching pairs of delicious food items!

## Overview
The game board consists of a set of cards each with an image of a food item hidden. The objective is to find and match pairs of the same food items. But beware! Make sure you don't click on the same image, or you'll have to try again.

## Features
Randomized Board: Every time you play, the board is shuffled to ensure a new challenge.
Interactive UI: Cards flip to reveal food images, and a message is displayed for matching and non-matching pairs.

## Food Items in the Game
- Cheeseburger
- Fries
- Hotdog
- Ice-Cream
- Milkshake
- Pizza

## Gameplay
- Click on a card to reveal the food item.
- Click on a second card, trying to find the matching pair to the first.
- If you've found a match, both cards will stay flipped. Otherwise, they'll turn back over.

## Future Enhancements
- Score System: Award points based on how quickly matches are found and penalize for incorrect matches.
- Extended Timer Functionality: Add start, pause, and reset controls for the timer.
